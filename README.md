# GraduationThesis_Deep learning in Sentimental Analysis
I had intended to reorganize the code to be cleaner and easier to look at. 
However, I still keep the original because this showed part of my learning process back then, full of trials and errors.

These are the code that I used in the Graduation Thesis.
Before this Thesis, all I know about ML/DL is the name only.
I didn't even have any sight of the existence of NLP.
Two main reasons I choose this topic are a good grade due to my supervisor's interest in ML/DL, and it might higher the chance of me getting a job.

I did some research in ML/DL and chose NLP.
I really wanted to use R as I was taught R at school, but I couldn't find any instructions, only Python.
So, I thought I could learn Python by myself.

At first, I followed a process I found on the internet, from re-processing the data to evaluating the model.
Then I showed it to my supervisor, he didn't like it. He asked me to add more details about the dataset and the models.
Therefore, from 1 code file at the beginning (snn.ipynb), I got 5 more (CD, bigram, postag, frequency, wordcloud) each of them is a different way that I had found to explore the data.
These codes were aggregated from many sources and modified to work with my dataset.

Finally, I got an A.
And more than that, which is more important now, I know that I could learn anything I want, by myself, with my computer connected to the internet.

I'm using this as part of my resume along with the PorfolioProject. So, sorry if you found this description "a bit" cringe and complacent. ^^
