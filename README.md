# GraduationThesis_Deep learning in Sentimental Analysis
I had intended to reorganize the code to be cleaner and easier to look at. 
However, I still keep the original because this showed part of my learning process back then, full of trials and errors.

These are the code that I used in the Graduation Thesis.
Before this Thesis, all I know about ML/DL is the name only.
I didn't even have any sight of the existence of NLP.
Two main reasons I choose this topic are a good grade due to my supervisor's interest in ML/DL, and it might higher the chance of me getting a job.

I did some research in ML/DL and chose NLP.
I really wanted to use R as I was taught R at school, but I couldn't find any instructions, only Python.
So, I thought I could learn Python by myself.

At first, I followed a process I found on the internet, from re-processing the data to evaluating the model.
Then I showed it to my supervisor, he didn't like it. He asked me to add more details about the dataset and the models.
Therefore, from 1 code file at the beginning, I got 5 more, each of them is a different way that I found to explore the data.
These codes were aggregated from many sources and modified to work with my dataset.

Finally, I got an A.
And more than that, which is more important now, I know that I could learn anything I want, by myself, with my computer connected to the internet.
